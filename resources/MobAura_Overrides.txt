# Use this file to override whether MobAura will attack a particular entity

# Lines beginning with # are ignored

# Config version number:
# If this is not found or does not match the current number, MobAura will replace your config with the default one.
R1

# ==== HOW TO SPECIFY ENTITES ====

# Use the entity's name, the one used in commands such as /spawnmob or @e[type=]
# For entities from mods, ask your mod author to provide the name

# =========== OVERRIDES ==========

# Use
# + name
# to tell MobAura to always attack a particular entity. For example,
# to tell MobAura to always attack zombies
# even if attacking hostile mobs is off, use
# + Zombie
# Similarly, use
# - name
# to tell MobAura to never attack a particular entity. For example,
# - Pig
# tells MobAura to never attack pigs.

# Place MobAura Overrides here (without the #)
